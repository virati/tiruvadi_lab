## Basics Vibes

### Reverse Engineering
There are more and more people calling themselves "reverse engineers" - more power to them.

My definition of RE anchors itself in *the human experience*.
In the case of medical research, proper RE focused on the clinical care of the patient.
That involves two primary parties: the *patient* and the *healer*.
They make measurements, inferences, and interventions in a layer independent of (patho)physiology - that's the layer I think we have to start in.

### Control Theory

### AI for Engineering-Driven-Science
I am not a scientist - in that I don't care much for careful/contrived experiments.
I think they actually lead to [misleading inferences]() and, when translated into patient care, can actually do harm.

Instead, I'm an engineer - focused on *making things better* and then reverse engineering the principles that made them better.

### Math, Not Measurements
We live in the era of big data, so it might be sacriligious to say: I hate data.
Data is the most boring part of science.
It's certainly important, but there are approaches to doing scientific inference that don't boil down to "collect so much data that even a monkey can see the curve".

That's the type of scientific inference I care about - and I also suspect it's the only type of inference that actually helps us make decisions in the real world, with all its chaos and clutter.

### Alliteration and Assonance
I love alliteration and assonance.
So I'll be doing them a lot.
